                    <p>Every time you search online for the best restaurant deal, share good news or bad with your Facebook friends, or tweet to your followers, your "audience" is bigger than you know.</p>
                    <p>That's because your every online move leaves cyber footprints that are rapidly becoming fodder for research without you ever realizing it. Using social media for academic research is accelerating and raising ethical concerns along the way, as vast amounts of information collected by private companies - including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter - are giving new insight into all aspects of everyday life.</p>
                    <p>Just consider that mining online communication has already helped Microsoft identify women at risk of postpartum depression. It's also allowed Facebook to study how parents and kids interact. The possibilities appear limited only by the imagination of the researchers, which is why such issues were in the spotlight recently at a meeting of social and personality psychologists. They gathered to concentrate on what's ahead amid concerns that some users of these sites may not like that their behavior is under the microscope. Even as this mining of huge digital data sets of collective behavior is on the rise, the word "caution" is coming from all sides.</p>
                    <p>"Be aware it is a space that is watched," says social psychologist Ilka Gleibs, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics in London, whose study about social networking sites for research field studies has been drawing attention since it went online in January in the journal <em>Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy</em>.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>"Facebook is transformed from a public space to a behavioral laboratory," says the study, which cites a Harvard-based research project of 1,700 college-based Facebook users in which it became possible to "deanonymize parts of the data set," or cross-reference anonymous data to make student identification possible.</p>
                    <p>"Sometimes it's easier than we think to identify this data," she says. "I'm not saying no one should ever do this kind of research, but I'm saying we should be more cautious when we use this data."</p>
                    <p>Some of Facebook's research on user behavior found that 71% of people drafted at least one post that they never posted. Another analyzed 400,000 posts and found that children's communication with parents decreases in frequency from age 13 but then rises when they move out.</p>
